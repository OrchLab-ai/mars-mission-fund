# Headless harness

Runs one task with Claude Code (`claude -p`) in its own git worktree.

```bash
harness/run-task.sh harness/tasks/define-tokens.md
```

Each run gets an id from the timestamp and a folder `/workspace/runs/<id>/`:

- `repo/` — git worktree on a new branch `harness/<id>` cut from the current HEAD, where the agent works. Your checkout is not touched.
- `events.jsonl` — every stream-json event, as it arrived.
- `run.log` — `npm ci` output, tool-call lines and claude's stderr.
- `result.md` — the agent's final message: its answer to the task.

The record is outside the worktree, so removing the worktree keeps it
(`git worktree remove /workspace/runs/<id>/repo`).

Whatever the agent changed is committed to the branch. The script prints the run id,
branch, model that ran, turns and cost, then the agent's final message, and exits with
the agent's status (non-zero on failure; 124 on timeout).

## Settings (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `HARNESS_MODEL` | `sonnet` | `--model` alias or full name |
| `MAX_TURNS` | `25` | turn cap |
| `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `900` | wall-clock limit |

The agent runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so it can do anything in the
container. Use it only here.
